# Master-Global-Super-Store
First case study project, involving data analysis, Google Sheets formulas, pivot tables, calculated columns &amp; generation of insights

After a long trajectory, a few months ago, the company Global Super Store, a leader in online product sales worldwide, set out to improve the efficiency of its operations through data analysis.

I was hired as a Data Analyst to carry out this study. I was provided with details of online orders placed by people from around the world during the period from January 1, 2013, to December 31, 2014.

The challenge was to develop the stages of a data analysis project, from the necessary ETL processes for exploratory analysis to presenting results through reports and an interactive dashboard in spreadsheets.

For all of this, I had to rely on the Field Glossary. Additionally, I was provided with two datasets: Master Global Super Store and Products Global Super Store, which assisted me assist with the task.
